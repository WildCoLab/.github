## Welcome to Wildlife Coexistence Lab at UBC

We are a group of researchers in the Faculty of Forestry at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. **Our research is focused on human-wildlife coexistence across multiple species and scales, with a particular emphasis on large-bodied terrestrial mammals**. 

> The lab is led by Dr. Cole Burton, Associate Professor in the Department of Forest Resources Management, and Canada Research Chair in Terrestrial Mammal Conservation.
